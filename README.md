# scalaz Task vs Scala Future

I created this repository to make it easy for people
to compare the scalaz Task and Scala Future. All I did was
add the necessary scalaz include statements to the *build.sbt* file,
and create `App`s from the original source code.

All credit for the code goes to [tpolecat](https://twitter.com/tpolecat), 
who created the original source code at this URL:

## About the code

The *v1* directory contains tpolecatâ€™s original source code, which
I created as Scala `App`s.

The *v2* directory contains slightly modified versions of those apps,
which calls the instances more than one time to see what the
behaviors are.
